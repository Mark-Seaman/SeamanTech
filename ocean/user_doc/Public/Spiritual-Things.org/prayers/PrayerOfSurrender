* Prayer Of Surrender *
[[Index]]


Lord, I yield myself to you.

Let your will be my delight today.

May your love be the pattern for my life.

I turn from seeking the applause of men to fully receive your acceptance.

I surrender my hopes, dreams, and ambitions.

Do with them what you will, whenever you want.

I place my family, friends, and future in your loving hands.

You care for them far more than I ever could.

I release my need to control, my craving for success, and my fear of failure.

Purge selfish motivations and other forms of evil.

Transform my heart and give me a longing for more of you.

Lead me to serve others effectively.

Use me to bring you glory and draw others to follow you.
