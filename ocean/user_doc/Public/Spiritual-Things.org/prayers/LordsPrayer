* Lord's Prayer *                 -*-muse-*-
[[Index]]

I come to you as your son, hold me close.

Your power, honor, and reputation are beyond my imagination.  You are infinite in every aspect.

You rule over everything that we see and can't see, since you created it all.

Let your will be expressed perfectly and your desires fulfilled in every situation.

Please supply everything I need, as you always have.  You are both faithful and generous to me.

Everything I truly need can be found in you. I don't need to look for any other source.

Forgive all of my sins.  I don't deserve it but I receive it.

Help me to forgive others that have harmed me. I release the desire for revenge.

Rescue me when I am tempted. Remind me to seek you in that moment.

Protect me when attacked. You will never abandon me.

You have rights to everything, everywhere, for all eternity.
