  Believers who are poor have something to boast about, for God has honored them. And
  those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them. They will fade away like a
  little flower in the field. The hot sun rises and the grass withers; the little flower
  droops and falls, and its beauty fades away. In the same way, the rich will fade away
  with all of their achievements.
