So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Jesus. And because you
belong to him, the Spirit has given you life and freed you from the power of
sin. Legalism was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful
nature. So God did what keeping the rules could not do. He sent his own Son in a
human body like us sinners, and declared an end to sinâ€™s control by giving his
Son as a sacrifice for our sins. He did this so that the legitimate legal
requirements would be fully satisfied for us, as we follow the Spirit instead of
our sinful nature.
