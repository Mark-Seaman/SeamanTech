Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless
them.

Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in
harmony with each other. 

Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think
you know it all!

Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can
see you are honorable. 

Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.
