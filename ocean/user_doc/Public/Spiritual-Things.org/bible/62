So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God’s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, “Daddy”, for his Spirit joins our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children and his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God’s glory.
