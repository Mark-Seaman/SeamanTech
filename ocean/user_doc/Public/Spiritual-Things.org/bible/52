Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to
speak, and slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God
desires. So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word
God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.
