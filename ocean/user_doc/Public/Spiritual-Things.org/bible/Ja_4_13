Look here, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and
will stay there a year. We will do business there and make a profit.”

How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the
morning fog—it’s here a little while, then it’s gone.

What you ought to say is, “If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or
that.”

Otherwise you are boasting about your own pretentious plans, and all such
boasting is evil.
