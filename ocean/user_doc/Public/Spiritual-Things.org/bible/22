Those dominated by the sinful nature are obessed by sinful things,while being controlled by the Holy Spirit makes us think about things that please the Spirit. So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God and it never will. Thatâ€™s why those controlled by sin can never please God.
