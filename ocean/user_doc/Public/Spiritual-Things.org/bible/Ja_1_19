Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen,
slow to speak, and slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the
righteousness God desires. So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives,
and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power
to save your souls.
