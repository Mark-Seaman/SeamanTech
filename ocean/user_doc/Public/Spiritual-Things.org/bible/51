  So dont be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. Whatever is good and perfect comes down
  to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens. He never changes
  or casts a shifting shadow. He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And
  we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.
