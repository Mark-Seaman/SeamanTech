  If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you.He will
  not rebuke you for asking. But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in
  God alone.

  Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of
  the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. Such people should not expect to
  receive anything from the Lord. Their loyalty is divided between God and the
  world, and they are unstable in everything they do.
