In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God
has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given
you. If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well. If
your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God
has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a
gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.
