Trust in the Lord with all your heart;
do not depend on your own understanding.
Seek his will in all you do,
and he will show you which path to take.

Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom.
Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
Then you will have healing for your body
and strength for your bones.

The Lord directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?

You can make many plans, but the Lord’s purpose will prevail.
