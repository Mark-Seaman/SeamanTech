 Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say,

   I will take revenge;
      I will pay them back,
      says the Lord.

  Instead,

   If your enemies are hungry, feed them.
      If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.
   In doing this, you will heap
      burning coals of shame on their heads.

  Dont let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.
