You are controlled by the Spirit, not sin, if you have the Spirit of God living in you. Remember that those who do not have Christ living in them do not belong to him at all. Christ lives in you, so even though sin will cause your body to die, the Spirit makes you right with God resulting in life. God's Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. Just as God raised Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your physical bodies by his Spirit living in you.
