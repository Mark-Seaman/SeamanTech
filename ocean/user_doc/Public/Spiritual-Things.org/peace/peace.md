# Finding Peace

There are four types of peace that we spend most of our lives pushing. We would
give everything to find the peace that we so desperately are seeking.


## Peace With Self

It may take many years to come to full understanding of what makes us unique.
From our earliest childhood we catch glimpses. But it takes time and the
experience of life to truly grasp how we are wired.  

Many of the things that drive us at a fundamental level are actually genetic
rather that learned.  To be sure our experiences influence us, but the
foundation of our personality is preprogrammed. It is fascinating to look at
identical twins separated at birth and see a large  amount of similarities on
seemingly random selections they have made.


### Identity - accepting my uniqueness

### Knowledge - building skill and work life

### Physical & mental health - avoiding destructive patterns

### Money and security - creating a desirable future


## Peace With Others

### People to love - several people you would die for

### People to enjoy - share life with each other

### People to work with - share the work load

### People to serve - without a reward


## Peace With Purpose

### Uniqueness - Who am I?

### Roles - What should I do?

### Limitations - What should I avoid?

### Prime directive - What is my legacy?


## Peace With God

### Repentance - choosing to follow God

### Redemption - restoration and healing

### Transformation - change of heart

### Purpose - reoriented desires
