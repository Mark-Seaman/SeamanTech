* Peace with God *

Life is really pretty pointless until we can find a power beyond ourselves.  We can pursue many
things to try to fulfill our deepest desires.  But apart from having a relationship with God,
nothing will ever satisfy us. Yielding control of our lives to God is an essential aspect of a rich
life. 

We humans have an amazing capacity for self-deception.  We see things through a very distorted
lens.  We believe things because we want to, not because they are true.  At some point in our lives
we must embrace absolute truth.  This is a simple acknowledgment of reality, rather than bending
the truth to match how we think it should be.

One of the most fascinating things about the good news of reconciliation, is that when we admit the
truth about ourselves we gain God's acceptance. When we acknowledge how hopeless life without God
is, we receive his hope. With the understanding of our weakness we begin to rely on his
strength. This begins a phenomenal process of transformation.

We receive the provisions of the Lord as a gift.  As we understand this we can stop trying so hard
to earn God's love. Nothing that we can do or be, is that great anyway.  We gain his favor by seeking
relationship with him, not by trying to do favors for him.  This changes the nature of every facet
of our lives.

When we spend time alone with God we find true peace.  Opening ourselves to his presence is the
only way to truly be at peace.  This does not occur automatically.  It happens when we consciously
lay down our own plans and demands, and simply receive his love.  This can be a hard thing for us
since we live such busy lives.  But is is well worth the effort.
