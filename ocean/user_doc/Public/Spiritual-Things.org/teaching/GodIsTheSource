* God Is The Source *                                                             -*-muse-*-

Jesus is the only source of everything that is truly good in our lives.  Although this sounds like a
platitude that every believer would agree with, I often deny it by trusting in other things.

Accepting Jesus as our Lord is not a one-time act, but a continual posture of the heart.  Each day
presents many opportunities to seek or deny him.

He has a wonderful plan for each day of my life.  Yet, I frequently opt for my own short-sighted
goals instead.  I am often so blind to the implications of doing this and the consequences of not
pursuing him wholeheartedly.

I have been thinking about this process a lot lately.  I want to follow God in every way.  At the
same time, I want to be in control. This creates a built-in conflict.

The bible teaches us that Jesus is the one that starts the work of redemption in us. We can not
muster either the desire or the ability in ourselves.

What is true at the beginning, holds throughout our lives.  He continually sustains the
transformation.  Will power is not enough to do the deep work required.

I experience this on a personal level when I spend time alone with God.  I pick a quiet and isolated
spot and invite him to make me aware of his presence. This gives him an opportunity to speak
while I am consciously listening to him.

My practice is simply to look at him, while he looks at me.  This is sometimes a supernatural
experience where he touches my spirit and brings refreshing.  He may bring his peace, plans, or
correction to me in that quiet place of openness.  

At other times, nothing much happens, but we enjoy each other's company.  These times of solitude
have a lingering effect throughout my day.  I am more aware of his presence in the middle of life's
turmoil.

This practice of being alone with God and quietly enjoying his presence has become the most
important activity that I have neglected for so many years.
