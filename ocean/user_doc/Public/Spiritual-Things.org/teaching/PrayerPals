* Invited on a Journey *

Recently the Lord has started doing a lot of work within me.  I feel like I am entering a new season
in my relationship with him.

As I have been growing in understanding, there are things that I believe could benefit others as
well.  Some of these things are based on life stage and time spent with God, so not everyone will be
able to relate to them.

Other aspects are of a personal nature and I only feel comfortable sharing them with others that I
trust.  Fortunately, the Lord has put some wonderful people in my life, and surrounded me with
people of great depth.

You are one of the people in my cirlce that I would like to share this journey with.  One of the
ways that I process spiritual things is to write about what the Lord is doing.  If you would be
open, I can share these things with you.  Let me know if you would like to receive occasional email
about the journey of spiritual formation.
