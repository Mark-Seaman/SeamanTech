* Seek Solitude * 

In the quietness of our inner being, thoughts are carefully nurtured.  That is
where hope and dreams can be persistently sustained.  In the solitude
resolutions are forged and difficult commitments made.  There intimacy can
flourish and our life is renewed and transformed.  We must maintain our inner
life or our strength will weaken and our resolve will dissipate.

In the solitude we must meet with God and wrestle with the issues that threaten
to destroy us.  This is the place where we truly find him. It is ironic that it
is also where we discover our true selves as well. Knowing God reveals things
about us that we would rather hide.

There is no substitute.  If we don't take time to be alone with God, then we
will never grow very deep.  Youth is fleeting, but immaturity can last a
lifetime.  We need time to connect at an emotional level with our creator.

This is the most valuable time that we will ever spend.  Yet, we so often miss
out on it for lesser activities.  Take care of your inner life.  Let God attend
to your deepest needs.
