* Trying Harder *                 -*-muse-*-

When it comes to loving God and others, trying harder does not get us any closer.  I often view my
attempts to become more loving as a gauge for my rating with God. It is a fruitless ploy to try and
earn approval from him. But he already loves me as much as he ever will.  There is nothing that can
be done to justify his love for me.

Sometimes I confuse my desire to love others with my own needs and agenda.  I may feel better about
myself when I am serving others. This can easily become the actual motivation for serving.  The activity
may be valid but the emotional motivation is not.  If I am serving others for my own benefit then it
is not really about true love.

This self-serving attitude just doesn't work. Doing holy activities for corrupted reasons ends up in
religious bondage and hypocrisy.  Instead I need the transformation of the Holy Spirit to give me a
legitimate desire to love others more.

The key issue is not giving more but receiving more.  I accept love, forgiveness, and nurture from
God. These things change my capacity to give them away to others.

This is not simply a transaction motivated by self-interest.  I don't try to love others to feel
good and build self esteem.  Instead, I accept his love freely.  This produces a desire within to
serve others.

This all begins by allowing God to impact my emotions with the full weight of his love.  As I know
him more, I will be changed into the person that he desires for me to be.
