* Character And Competence *                 -*-muse-*-

True leadership is about influence. The ability to influence others is determined largely by
character and competence over a sustained period of time.

Character is about internal personal issues:

 * Integrity
 * Openness
 * Commitment and passion
 * Willingness to server others
 * Self-control
 * Flexibility
 * Dependabilty
 * Teamwork

Competence is about having knowledge and the ability to translate it into accomplishing the tasks at hand.

It is entirely possible to have one of these but not the other. Either one will jeopardize the
ability to influence others. A leader must always be examining and growing in both of these arenas
in order to be effective.

Lord, examine my life and show me where my character or competence is flawed and incomplete. Help me
to meet you in those areas. Reveal your plan for how to deal with these gaps. Cause me to grow in
influence.
