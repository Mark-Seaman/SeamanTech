* More Listening, Less Talking *                 -*-muse-*-

Prayer is about relationship with the living God.  But for years, I have viewed prayer as something
I ought to do.  Recently prayer times have taken on a lot more listening, and a lot less striving to
get it right.

We seldom inform God of anything. God does not really require our help to know what needs done. This
sounds a bit outlandish, but it is totally how we feel.  Prayer is more about simply being with God,
and enjoying his presence. Nothing more.  We may discuss needs as a part of that relationship, or not.

In prayer we find peace and rest from the struggle of life.  As we embrace God's Spirit in our inner
most place, we tap into the true source of peace.  Let's face it.  This life is loud, demanding,
stressful, and often hostile.  We desparately need Jesus daily to make sense of the heartbreak that
we all experience.

God longs to invite us into his plans.  We all long to live lives that matter.  Purpose is not
something that we invent for ourselves.  But it is something that we hear from God.  During prayer
the Lord is able to whisper his plans for me.  It is in when I am most receptive that I am likely to
hear what God intends.

Prayer is where we experience companionship and intimacy with God.  Prayer is like having a date
night with your spouse.  It is possible to do it and have a bad time together. But by committing to
spend time with one another regularly, you will inevitably find times of real joy and
refreshing. Prayer is a time for companionship and discussing any concerns.

All conversations go better with more listening, and less talking.  Even the one with God.
