Thoughts on Prayer

Recently, I have been really challenged to grow deeper in my prayer life. I have
realized just how shallow my prayer life really is.  It is not clear how we grow
in prayer or even what the final destination is.

The Lord has shown me some of both of these.  I started reading a book, called
"Prayer as a Place", by Charles Bello.  It discusses many different forms of
prayer that I have not encountered before. Several people at the Vineyard
Missions Conference had recommended it, so I thought it would be worth a try.

From the very beginning of the book I was challenged to think about my
prayer life very differently.  The author describes how the various spiritual
practices are designed to help us encounter God in different ways.

There is an upward movement including practices like worship, thanksgiving, and
adoration.  There is an outward movement involving practices of evangelism,
petition, and intercession.  And finally, there is an inward movement involving
practices like bible meditation, experiencing God's presence, repentance,
confession, and inner healing.

Protestants are pretty good at the first two, but almost totally unaware of the
inward journey.  Our experience of God is always "out there", but we are afraid
to encounter God in the quiet moments where we protect our inner-most thoughts.

This ultimately leads to a dual-life where we become increasingly protective of
our public presence. We won't let anyone near our private selves.  We shut that
off from our closest friends, God, and even ourselves.

As we invite God into our inner-sanctum, it may be painful at first.  But he
also brings the healing that we so desperately need.  Recieving God's love lets
trust others with more access to our private lives.

This describes the personal journey that I am on.  It is both exhilarating and
frightening at the same time.
