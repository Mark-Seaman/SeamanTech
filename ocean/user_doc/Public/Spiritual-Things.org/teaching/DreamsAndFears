* Embrace your dreams and fears 

To truly understand what is in a person's heart you must understand their
deepest emotions.  We care about some things so much that they seem to drive
everything we do.

You may have strong emotions that cause certain behaviors that you are not even
fully conscious of. This can cause a lot of additional turmoil in your life and
for those around you.

Identifying you top dreams is a great step in coming to grips with motivational
issues.  The top dreams are the ones that are close to your central identify.
These are the things that define the difference between a good day and a bad
one.

Your top dreams are not always obvious.  They are almost never a simple career
goal or a role to play.  They go much deeper than that.  But your top dreams may
have a lot to do with your career choices and roles that you take on.

To capture your dreams try this simple exercise.  Find a quiet place and make a
list of the five things you most want from your life.  This is the first cut but
probably not the core list.

Now test it.  Assume that the things you wrote down are all that you get for the
rest of your life. You must give up everything else to get these five things.
Did you miss anything?

Now it is time to be more specific.  Select each dream and see if you can
identify the crux of what makes that dream important to you.  What is the
smallest thing that truly captures the essence of your dream?

I did a similar exercise related to my core fears at a differnt time. I was
surprised to find almost complete overlap in the lists.  It makes sense that,
what we long for is also what we fear losing most.

Share these things with your two closest friends.  Tell how these dreams define
who you are.  Get their feedback to help refine your language on each of them.
You will find this coversation very liberating.

Your dreams are a large part of what defines you.  You are what you dream about.
