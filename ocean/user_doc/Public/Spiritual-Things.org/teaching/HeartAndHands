* A Matter of Heart and Hands * 


The art of solitude is wrongly understood if it is seen as leading to withdrawal
from others. It is not meant to enhance the self at the cost of maintaining
concern for others. Instead, solitude is a way to enrich the self in order that
we may more fully join with others. Solitude is meant to enrich the practice of
community.

While community is the reality we are to live, solitude helps us to live there.
Nouwen says that "community ... is primarily a quality of the heart." It is not
primarily a matter of particular structures. It is first of all a recognition
that in the faces of other people, I am aware of Christ's call to
interdependence, sharing, serving, receiving, mutuality, encouragement, and
companionship. Community is thus, first of all, a particular vision of life.

But it also involves a practical joining together. Nouwen notes that "we will
never know what community is if we never come together in one place." Heart and
hands must therefore meet. Ideals must find a practical outworking. Our dreams
of cooperation and sharing life together must be realized with courage and
perseverance in an age characterized by independence, self-sufficiency, and
isolation.

In the quest of realizing our dreams, we need to make sure that the matter of
the heart does not get lost through a preoccupation with the structures of
community.
