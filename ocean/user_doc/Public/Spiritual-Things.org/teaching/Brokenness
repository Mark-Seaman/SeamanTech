* Brokenness *                 -*-muse-*-

Brokenness is the first step in healing.  Although we seek to avoid it, we find that pain can be
very constructive in our spiritual development. When we feel broken, we are more open to the
presence of God than at any other time. This can be the cause of an important transformation.

We all desire to hide from pain.  I never intentionally sign up for the pain program.  On the
contrary, I view it as something to be avoided at all costs.  But even with that attitude, pain is
an inescapable part of our human existence.

Pain can cause us to admit the truth ourselves, and God.  Carefully constructed fortresses of denial
can be penetrated as we open up to God's presence.  This may spark a profound turning point in our
lives. His truth causes us to see everything from a different perspective.  This may be a permanent
change in our thinking.

God longs to pour out mercy and love. But most of the time I am not ready for it.  When I feel
frustrated, without hope, weak, and vulnerable, I am ready to receive his comfort.  At my lowest
point, I most experience the presence of God.  In my darkest hour I discover his astounding light.

The path to wholeness leads through the valley of brokenness.  This is one of the greatest ironies
of a life with God.  When we lose our life we find true life in Jesus.  God's greatest goal for us
is that we experience the fullness of a life lived with him. Even if pain is the catalyst, we
welcome the work that is being done and the goal that he has for us.
