Hope is the wind beneath our wings…

When we’re afraid to fly
It lifts our spirits when they’re low and calms us when we cry.
Hope is the glue that mends the heart…that’s broken now and then
And encourages the fallen to rise and try again.

Hope is the balm that soothes the pain when sorrow comes to call
The anodyne that heals the hurt and takes the fear away
Hope is the star that leads the way throughout the silent night 
When dreams have been shattered and no relief’s in sight

Hope is the prayer that’s answered one step at a time,
When mountains become molehills that we have to climb
Life always has its ups and downs and we must learn to cope,
For failures are never fatal as long as there is hope.
