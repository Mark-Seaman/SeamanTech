* Live out your dreams *                                                                -*-muse-*-

What we dream for says a lot about who we are.  Evaluate your dreams.  How are you fulfilling them?
Let this be a focal power in your prayer time.  Your deepest dreams are a reflection of God's purpose
for you.  God gradually changes what you most desire.

Because of this transformation, we can be confident that he will give us his dreams.   These are a
direct reflection of his purpose for our lives.  Of course, this is only true to the extent that we
are following him.  It is not simply automatic because we call ourselves Christian.

God will fulfill every desire that he has placed within you.  You get your deepest needs met because
they are completely aligned with his purpose for you.  As you are transformed you desire the things
that God does. 

You can truly know God's will for your life.  It does not need to be a mystery any longer. Your
dreams are a unique reflection of God's plan for you.

This is also why the process of transformation can be painful.  The Lord messes with the things that
you most value.   He is continuously shaping your desires.  When he is done you will look a lot more
like him.

This plan is specific to you, so don't let anyone else define what you ought to be.  God will reveal
his purpose to you as you seek to be obedient to him.  The dreams that you have for your life are
one of the primary ways that God guides you. 

Take the time to get in touch with the things that you really long for.  Create your own list and
pray over it.  Make it a focal point of dialog with God. This approach can help you make decisions
with greater clarify and confidence.
