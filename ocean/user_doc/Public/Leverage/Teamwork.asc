*** Build a culture of Leverage

Products reflect the organizations that create them.  Every organization has a
personality. That culture will dictate what the human experience of working
there will be like. Some organizations are filled with life.  They inspire each
person to bring their best each day. They encourage risk taking and exploration
even when it  leads to failure. They build teams that freely collaborate with
each other and provide an environment where everyone has the freedom to succeed.
They produce products that delight customers and are just right for the
marketplace.

Other organizations focus on heavy control.  The leaders at the top make all
of the decisions and the staff is expected to carry out each decision without
question.  There is a lot of talk about loyalty and rules for everything. Fear
rules and any failures are met with punishment. Nobody wants to work there 
and everyone who is remains feels trapped. These organizations create products
that are confusing and difficult to use. Eventually the marketplace results
suffer for the poor environment within the company.

Which organization will you work for?  Well run companies will produce 
high-quality products.  But even well run teams within poorly run companies can have
a history of repeatable successes. Great products come from great teams. Of all
the things that an organization can do to improve its software development
capability, there is probably no other area that will produce an equivalent 
return on investment.  Building a high-performance team is essential to every
other aspect of process improvement.


**** Culture and world view

My father is a cultural anthropologist. I grew up on stories of strange customs
of people from other cultures. A recurring theme was understanding why people do
seemingly irrational things. The answers can be found by understanding the
culture and the world view that drives it. Later, when I entered the world of
high-tech I found another strange culture was at play.  A strong world view
applied to everything we did.  Those that violated the code were severely
punished. A some deeds would cause active banishment for life.

While readily adopting this world view, I remained puzzled over many of the
inconsistencies that were present.  In any culture the rules are seldom recorded
but strictly enforced by everyone in the community. Some communities actually do
document their world view to help newcomers understand.  The HP Way and the
Python Code of Conduct, both describe principles that are valued and the
practices that they demand.  This can be really helpful to avoid cultural
blunders.

In order to change a culture you must truly understand what drives
it. Lets explore the high-tech culture and see how we can affect a positive
change.  We will study the beliefs that drive behavior in order to influence
the harmful dysfunction that we see. This is the only path possible to
meaningful change.


**** Belief systems

Cultures are driven by a world view. A person's world view is unseen by them
until someone opposes it. There are key assumptions that are readily embraced
and never questioned.  An entire world view is supported by specific paradigms,
which each provide a fundamental understanding of the world.  A common mental
model allows everyone in the community to be aligned, by sharing the same
beliefs. We believe that all normal and decent people think the same way.

We choose to be a part of a community because we share a large number of
paradigms with them.  We resonate with the ideas that are shared and are
repelled by those we don't.  The world-view allows us to readily distinguish
between people like us and outsiders. 

Let me illustrate this with two examples. The open source community believes
that sharing is good. It is a self-evident truth that ideas should be readily
exchanged with little thought to collecting money.  While the fortune 500
culture views intellectual property primarily from a security perspective. If
sharing information is viewed as thievery it is difficult to embrace the open
sharing ideals.  These two paradigms are directly in opposition with each other.
Which one is right?  They are opposing paradigms.  It will depend on which
community you are drawn to. Once you make this choice it becomes very difficult
to function under another paradigm.

Another example is related to our view of competition.  Some cultures promote
sharing of information. People are rewarded for helping others and furthering
the cause of understanding. In other cultures, people are rewarded for knowing
more than anyone else.  Most academic and corporate environment discourage any
helping of others as a loss of personal advantage. The corporate environment
where I spend the bulk of my career was based on a forced ranking of employees
doing the same job. Helping someone else might move you from a 62% rating to a
60%. On occasion employees would actively sabotage the success of others in 
subtle ways hoping to better their standing.
