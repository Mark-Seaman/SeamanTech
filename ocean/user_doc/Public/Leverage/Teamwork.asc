=== Build a culture of Leverage

Products reflect the organizations that create them.  Every organization has a
personality. That culture will dictate what the human experience of working
there will be like. Some organizations are filled with life.  They inspire each
person to bring their best each day. They encourage risk taking and exploration
even when it  leads to failure. They build teams that freely collaborate with
each other and provide an environment where everyone has the freedom to succeed.
They produce products that delight customers and are just right for the
marketplace.

Other organizations focus on heavy control.  The leaders at the top make all
of the decisions and the staff is expected to carry out each decision without
question.  There is a lot of talk about loyalty and rules for everything. Fear
rules and any failures are met with punishment. Nobody wants to work there 
and everyone who is remains feels trapped. These organizations create products
that are confusing and difficult to use. Eventually the marketplace results
suffer for the poor environment within the company.

Which organization will you work for?  Well run companies will produce 
high-quality products.  But even well run teams within poorly run companies can have
a history of repeatable successes. Great products come from great teams. Of all
the things that an organization can do to improve its software development
capability, there is probably no other area that will produce an equivalent 
return on investment.  Building a high-performance team is essential to every
other aspect of process improvement.


==== Culture and world view

My father is a cultural anthropologist. I grew up on stories of strange customs
of people from other cultures. A recurring theme was understanding why people do
seemingly irrational things. The answers can be found by understanding the
culture and the world view that drives it. Later, when I entered the world of
high-tech I found another strange culture was at play.  A strong world view
applied to everything we did.  Those that violated the code were severely
punished. A some deeds would cause active banishment for life.
