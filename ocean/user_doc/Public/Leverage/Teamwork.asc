=== Build a Culture of Leverage

Products reflect the organizations that create them. Every organization has a
personality and a culture that will dictate what the human experience of
working there will be like. Some organizations are filled with life, they
inspire each person to bring their best each day. They encourage risk-taking
and exploration even when it may lead to failure. They build teams that freely
collaborate with each other and provide an environment where everyone has the
freedom to succeed. They create products that delight customers and are just
right for the marketplace.

Other organizations focus on heavy control. The leaders at the top make every
decision and the staff is expected to carry out these mandates without
question. There is a lot of talk about loyalty and there are rules for
everything. Fear is pervasive and failures are met with punishment. This is
the old "Command and Control" management style that works fairly well in low-
skill environments but is disastrous in creative companies that live on
innovation and new ideas. An organization running on a strict hierarchical
system will create products that are confusing and difficult to use. A
persistent decline of market share is the inevitable result of the
dysfunctional environment within the company.

Well-run companies will naturally produce high-quality products and it is
possible for a good team within a dysfunctional company to have a history of
repeatable successes if they are isolated enough within their company. Great
products come from great teams. Of all the things that an organization can do
to improve its software development capability, building great teams will
create the largest benefit. Building high-performance teams is essential to
every other aspect of process improvement.


==== Culture and Worldview

My father is a cultural anthropologist so I grew up on stories of strange
customs of people from other cultures. A recurring theme was understanding why
people do things that seem irrational to anyone outside of their culture. The
answers can be found by understanding the worldview and values that drives the
culture. As an adult I discovered that the high tech had its own strange
culture with a strong worldview applied to everything we did. Those that
violated the cultural values were severely punished and some deeds would cause
exile or immediate termination.

While readily adopting this worldview, I remained puzzled over many of the
inconsistencies that were present. In any culture the rules are seldom
recorded, even though they are strictly enforced by everyone in the community.
Some communities actually do document their worldview to help newcomers
understand. The HP Way and the Python Code of Conduct both describe principles
that are valued and the expected practices within their communities. These
documents serve as a guide and can help newbies avoid cultural blunders.

In order to change a culture you must truly understand what drives it. We need
to study the beliefs that drive behavior in order to reverse dysfunction and
affect a positive change in high tech corporate culture.


==== Belief Systems

Cultures are driven by a worldview. A person's world view is unseen by them
until someone else opposes it. There are key assumptions that are naturally
embraced and never questioned. An entire worldview is supported by specific
paradigms, which each provide a fundamental understanding of the world. A
common mental model allows everyone in the community to be aligned because
they share the same beliefs. The community believes that all _normal and
decent_ people think the same way.

We often choose to be part of a community because we share a large number of
paradigms with them. We resonate with the ideas that are shared and are
repelled by those we don't share. The worldview allows us to readily
distinguish between people like us and outsiders.

Let me illustrate this with two examples. The open source community believes
that sharing is good. It is a self-evident truth that ideas should be readily
exchanged with little thought to collecting money. While the Fortune 500
culture views intellectual property primarily from a security perspective. If
sharing information is viewed as thievery it is difficult to embrace any open
sharing ideals. These two paradigms are directly in opposition with each
other. Which one is right? It will depend on which community you are drawn to.
Once you make this choice, it becomes very difficult to function under another
paradigm.

Another example is related to our view of competition. Some cultures promote
sharing of information. People are rewarded for helping others and furthering
the cause of understanding. In other cultures, people are rewarded for knowing
more than anyone else. Most academic and corporate environments discourage
individuals from helping others because of the perceived loss of personal
advantage. Many corporate environments are based on a forced ranking of
employees doing the same job. Helping someone else might move you from a 62%
rating to a 60%. In this type of environment employees will actively sabotage
