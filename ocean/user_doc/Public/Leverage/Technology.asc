=== Technology Provides Leverage

Software development is about solving problems. Sometimes this requires building 
an entire solution from scratch, but more often your solution will be built on
top of existing technology that solves many of the problems for you.  

Technology selection is really a form of leverage - you are using existing
software to produce a solution without having to build your own software for the
same purpose. A single tool may reflect the knowledge of thousands of hours of
careful thought and development. When you build your own tool without
considering an existing solution you may be duplicating problems that others
have solved well.

This chapter will focus solely on how to optimize the selection process so that
every project gets a boost from the use of a great tool set.

==== How Technology Selection Affects Leverage

Every solution that we build is based on some supporting technologies. This
makes decisions about technology selection critical to the success of every
project. Many organizations fail to give the technology selection the
attention it deserves and some decisions are made arbitrarily.

Choosing good technology can give a project an extra boost. A stable set of
technologies is important for ongoing productivity. Switching technologies too
often can have a detrimental effect on the project because of the learning curve
involved. The reverse is true as well - continued use of old technology when new
tools could provide a ten times boost in productivity can doom a company.
Leverage requires careful management and timing of technology changes.

==== Standardize on Great Tools

When you find a suitable standard solution - use it as much as possible. Only
build your own technology when you can't find a workable solution from somewhere
else. Building your own tools will cost you roughly ten times the amount of
using existing tools.

Fill the gaps in your tool set by being intentional about looking for new tools.
