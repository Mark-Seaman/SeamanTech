*** Versioning

Version control is critical to deployment

Automation should be built on top of git

Control server environments and branches

Fully automatic release


**** Everything is Under Version Control

CM artifacts

Understanding what is truly source code

Control important tool versions

Create reproducible results
  

**** Standard Branch Policy

Different uses for branches

    Use branches to experiments
    Use branches for phased integration
    Use branches to isolate responsibilities
    Use branches to stabilize changes

Example branch policies

    Production (major/minor)
    Staging
    Test
    Feature branches
    Experimental branches


**** Release Branches

[[releases]]
.Git Branches for Releases

Requirements for release branches

* master is point of integration
* stabilization branches slow rate of change
* release branches subdivide for each minor release
* release branches are often merged back into master


**** Release Labeling

Branches capture a series of commits; label mark a single commit

Standardize product labeling policy

Create a label for each production version

    Every time production roles there should be a label create

Example labeling strategy -- Release 1.2.7.100

    1 - Major release #1
    1.2 - Minor release
    1.2.7 - Release number
    1.2.7.100 - Build #100 for 1.2.7 release


**** Release Work Flow

Regular builds for development

Deploy to test servers

Detailed testing in test environment

Promotion to staging

Testing in staging environment

Promotion to production

Careful monitoring in production
