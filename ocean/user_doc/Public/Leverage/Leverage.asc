=== Software is Central to Modern Life

In 2011, Marc Andreessen famously stated that "Software is Eating the World".
Every industry has experienced a remarkable transformation due to the growing
dominance of software. Entire industries like bookstores, music stores, movie
studios, newspapers, photography, and financial services, have been replaced by
software-based services. Software is no longer a secondary player - it's the
main show and will dictate whether your business succeeds or fails. Business now
runs 24/7 and software is at the very heart of this amazing revolution.

Great software systems create business success - they can automate repetitive
tasks and free up resources to continue innovating in other areas. Humans are
great at solving problems and computers are great at running those solutions.
With each problem that is solved, more opportunity is created to deliver greater
value. The business now has a solution that can keep delivering value for an
ever decreasing cost. Resources and attention can now pivot to solving the next
round of business problems. Innovation spawns more innovation and forms a
productive feedback loop.

The reverse is also true - inadequate software can easily destroy an otherwise
healthy business. Because software is so central to every aspect of business
today, a company can be crippled by software systems that don't meet the
business needs.

Think about the national healthcare initiative, healthcare.gov, and its high
profile flop. Thousands of hours of planning and development costing millions of
dollars culminated in a failed deployment of a web application. The failure
created extra scrutiny, loss of credibility, and several key leaders lost their
jobs.

This drama plays out every day in every industry. Companies, governments, and
other organizations that don't understand how to develop software systems that
match critical business needs are doomed to extinction. The answer to this
threat is to apply the leverage principle to every facet of software development
and operations.
