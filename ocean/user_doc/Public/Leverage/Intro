The cost difference between a successful project and a failed one is huge.   Recent articles have stated that 44% of government projects never deliver their core value and that only 16% of projects fit within the planned cost.  This is a horrible state of affairs representing a colossal waste of resources.

When investigating the failures and successes, a set of core characteristics emerge that act are leading indicators of a projects success.  I've been studying software development over the last 35 years and had the privilege of seeing around a hundred projects go to market.   I noticed trends that indicate a projects success or failure.

These characteristics can be observed very early in the development project.  Any project that is missing these attributes will have a very low likelihood of success.   But projects that start with a solid foundation will almost always finish well.
