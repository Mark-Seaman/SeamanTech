**Best Practice #1** - Make leverage your primary goal

=== Software is central to modern life

In 2011, Marc Andreessen famously stated that "Software is Eating the World". 
Every industry has experienced a remarkable transformation due to the growing 
dominance of software. Entire industries like bookstores, music stores, movie 
studios, newspapers, photography, and financial services, have been replaced by
software-based services. Software is no longer a secondary player - it's the 
main show and will dictate whether your business succeeds or fails. Business now
runs 24/7 and software is at the very heart of this amazing revolution.

Great software systems create business success - they can automate repetitive 
tasks and free up resources to continue innovating in other areas. 
With each problem that is solved, more opportunity is created to deliver
greater value. The business now has a solution that can keep delivering value 
for an ever decreasing cost. Resources and attention can now pivot to solving the 
next round of business problems.

Humans are great at solving problems and computers are great at running those
solutions. As new systems are deployed the value a company increases resulting
in growth for the business. Innovation spawns more innovation and forms a
productive feedback loop.

The reverse is also true - inadequate software can easily destroy an otherwise
healthy business. Because software is so central to every aspect of business
today, a company can be crippled by software systems that do not meet the
business needs.

Think about the national healthcare initiative, healthcare.gov and its high
profile flop. Thousands of hours of planning and development costing millions of
dollars culminated in a failed deployment of a web application. The failure
created extra scrutiny, loss of credibility, and several key leaders lost their
jobs.

This drama plays out every day in every industry. Companies, governments, and 
other organizations that do not understand how to develop software systems that 
match critical business needs are doomed to extinction.


==== Importance of leverage

One definition of leverage is using something to maximum advantage. The goal for
every software development project should be to utilize every asset -
everything you've previously built, everything your team learned about the
business needs, every skill and bit of expertise in a technology platform.
Utilize these previous investments rather than creating them new every single
time.  No one can afford to rebuild infrastructure that has already been laid.

Software development is expensive and it is far more expensive
