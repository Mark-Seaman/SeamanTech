== Preface

Developing software is far more costly than it needs to be. Companies that
understand and apply best practices can produce dramatically better results.
Software arrives earlier to market with less cost and it also continues to 
work much longer.

The key difference is in the ability to leverage the understanding over 
multiple generations of development.  This produces a repeatable and
predictable development process. Building a set of best practices reverses
the natural process of bit rot allowing the software to stay in operation
far longer.

This book builds a case for establishing best practices in three important
areas. We will explore the most common problems that block leverage and
propose solutions in the form of best practices. This book is meant to provide
solid advice to people actively doing software architecture and design.

* **Architectural Concerns**

+ 
This section delve into issues related to the
actual services that you are building.  We discuss how the manage technology
over time.  We also explore ways to create architectures that can be used
on multiple generations of products. We look at the critical practices for
reducing the software decay process. Testing strategies that probe the code
from different direction create an architectural resilience that is needed
to have software systems that last for years.

* **Operational Concerns** 

+ 
Operational integrity is a vital concern for every
business.  We will explore the release cycle and best practices associated
the software after development. We will look at techniques for managing 
the health of the software over its entire lifetime. We will also outline 
the proven tools and practices that lower operational costs.

* **People Concerns** 

+
We will explore how the people issues within your business
affect the way that software is developed.  Since knowledge is your primary
asset, you need to manage learning within your team to achieve the desired
goals. We will see how you can manage the sharing of knowledge and planning
to support higher levels of leverage within your organization.
