=== Leverage Understanding

Building software is about solving problems and requires a broad scope of
understanding; understanding gained in previous work is applied to new
problems. We can't afford to learn everything from scratch each time, but that
is exactly what most groups do inadvertently. Throughout my career I have had
the opportunity to work with many different development teams. Few
organizations have effective tools for managing knowledge. They may be very
advanced in how they deal with source code but completely disabled when
dealing with knowledge that is not software.

This chapter will offer some tools to help you organize the knowledge that is
scattered throughout your team. A system is required to leverage our
understanding of current problems into the solutions needed tomorrow. This
type of leverage is often missing because we don't have an effective way to
gather and share the knowledge that our team already has. Building an
effective way to deal with information is a critically important aspect of
becoming more productive.

You need an efficient way to store and retrieve knowledge within your
organization. Relying on the memory of individual staff members or private
notes on their computers is unreliable and will lead to a lot of wasted time
and effort to relearn valuable knowledge. Without a knowledge management
system, vital information will be lost everytime there is a personnel change
on a project. .

A storehouse of knowledge that truly captures everything that your team needs
to know is essential. Create an easy way to find all of the information
quickly and make it easy for people contribute new information. If it is too
difficult to add information it will cause people to ignore the system.

This chapter explores how to build a great information retrieval and sharing
system that is low cost to both set up and run. There are several different
aspects of dealing with information to consider. Understanding goes through
distinct stages of refinement and different activities are needed to deal with
knowledge throughout each stage. Think of these aspects as a "Knowledge Life
Cycle".
