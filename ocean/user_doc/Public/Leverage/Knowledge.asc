*** Leverage Understanding

Building software is about solving problems and requires a broad scope of
understanding; understanding gained in previous work is applied to new
problems. We can't afford to learn everything from scratch each time, but that
is exactly what most groups do inadvertently. Throughout my career I have had
the opportunity to work with many different development teams. Few
organizations have effective tools for managing knowledge. They may be very
advanced in how they deal with source code but completely disabled when
dealing with knowledge that is not software.

This chapter will offer some tools to help you organize the knowledge that is
scattered throughout your team. A system is required to leverage our
understanding of current problems into the solutions needed tomorrow. This
type of leverage is often missing because we don't have an effective way to
gather and share the knowledge that our team already has. Building an
effective way to deal with information is a critically important aspect of
becoming more productive.

You need an efficient way to store and retrieve knowledge within your
organization. Relying on the memory of individual staff members or private
notes on their computers is unreliable and will lead to a lot of wasted time
and effort to relearn valuable knowledge. Without a knowledge management
system, vital information will be lost everytime there is a personnel change
on a project. .

A storehouse of knowledge that truly captures everything that your team needs
to know is essential. Create an easy way to find all of the information
quickly and make it easy for people contribute new information. If it is too
difficult to add information it will cause people to ignore the system.

This chapter explores how to build a great information retrieval and sharing
system that is low cost to both set up and run. There are several different
aspects of dealing with information to consider. Understanding goes through
distinct stages of refinement and different activities are needed to deal with
knowledge throughout each stage. Think of these aspects as a "Knowledge Life
Cycle".

* Capture - The process of recording new ideas as they occur
* Organize - Ideas need collaboration and connections to other related ideas
* Refine - Editing and critique are essential parts of building great ideas
* Share - To be useful, an idea should be shared with others outside the team

As knowledge develops through each stage the idea will be strengthened and
refined into something that provides unique business value. If an idea fails
to be developed in one of these stages it will tend to atrophy and die. Review
is a key goal of having a well-defined process for managing information. By
making it easy to see the progress of many ideas, you can also spot ideas that
are stuck and in need of attention.


*** Capture - Where Ideas Go to Thrive

No idea is birthed fully formed. A small idea may come in the form of a hunch
or an unsolved problem so capture the concept before it evaporates. A quick
note in a tool like Evernote is be adequate to record the concept and spark
the memory at a later time. Then this reminder can be used to more fully
reconstruct the original thought. Ideas that start as a simple concept can be
expanded into a full-blown product plan over time. Capturing information
should involve the following elements.

* Identify the problem
* Identify the solution
* Identify the context where the idea applies
* Identify the limitations and caveats for applying the idea

A knowledge system must be exceedingly easy to use - this is a critical
requirement. Engineers are busy and they will only use tools that they see
immediate value in. Anything that looks like busywork will be neglected and
fall quickly into disuse.

Ideas come and go quickly - your tools need to be setup to take advantage of
the fleeting nature of ideas. The system you define needs be accessible from
anywhere. Whether the device at hand is a phone, post-it note, email, random
text file, photo, or a screen shot - they must all be compatible with your
knowledge management system in order to get people to accept and use it.


**** Window of Opportunity

Any new idea must be recorded within 15 seconds because if it takes any longer
people will skip using it, resulting in lost ideas. They will make a mental
note and then promptly forget to follow through. Count the number of steps
that are required to record an idea. Here is an example capture path:

* Light bulb goes on (attention: great idea formed)
* Grab my phone
* Click on Idea app
* Type a few words to record the thought for later
