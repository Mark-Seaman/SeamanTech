=== Services that Scale

Building web services is perhaps the most common software task today. This
produces some unique opportunities for reuse.  We can create parts of a solution
that are easily isolated from one another.  Each of these services can solve a
simple problem and may end up having a different life-cycle than the rest of the
services that we use.  This promotes reuse by letting us repurpose existing
solutions to solve new problems.

The rise of microservices has given us new design ideas.  We can now think 
about building and deploying systems that are much more focused on solving a
specific part of the overall product.  Then we can build more complex systems
by integrating them together to provide robust solutions for our customers.

Each of the services are built to address a specific concern.  By limiting the
functionality of each system we can build systems that are far easier to
construct and operate.  Control and data flow must be designed to meet the
business needs.  The services paradigm makes scaling far easier than it has 
ever been. 

As the number of users push the boundaries of the existing system new designs
are needed to address the increased demand.  The well-designed architecture
built around services allows portions of the system to be replaced to
accommodate the new demands without disrupting the entire system.  Therefore
our architecture directly sets the leverage potential of our web services.


==== Scaling your Architecture

Services are intended to work well for some number of users.  As demand increases
minor changes can be made to provide the required performance up to a certain
limit.  Eventually the demands of the new users can't be met by the current 
solution.  New bottlenecks emerge as the system grows. A system that works 
well for 100 concurrent users will not work for 1000, and a solution for 10,000
users will not scale to 100,000. 

Usage can be measured in requests per second that the system is intended to
respond to. Every order of magnitude in usage requires that some fundamental 
elements of the design be revisited.  Each of these orders in growth represents
a technical horizon, and typically has a corresponding business horizon for 
the company as well. What is your next horizon and how quickly do you need to
meet it?  Some business are under tremendous pressure to scale while others
are not.

This chapter lays out some principles and practices that will help you scale
