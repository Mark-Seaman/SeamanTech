=== Learning is a Strategic Capability

Many companies act like learning is a necessary evil.  They screen rigorously
for specific technology skills when hiring. The underlying belief is that
knowledge that a new person has is what they will need to be successful. The
truth is what an engineer knows is less important than their ability to learn
quickly. Each person only knows a fraction of the skills that they will need two
years from now. Technology moves so fast that the half-life with specific
technology skills is probably about eighteen months.  Any engineer that stops
learning is on a rapid decline in their career.

Current knowledge is important because it offers a base of understanding that
can be built onto. However, learning allows a person to grow into whatever
situation they need to. How often have you added a new person to a team in time
for a change in the project that rendered their specific skill unnecessary. I
would rather hire a smart and motivated person than a knowledgeable one.

There are two primary skills from which all other engineering skills emanate.
Analytical thinking and problem solving allow engineers to tackle and solve
complex engineering problems.  But it is the ability learn quickly and 
effectively that fuels all the other skills that are vital to a successful
career.  What you know now is not nearly as critical to your success as your
ability to learn.
