*** Flexible planning

At the start of a software project there is a tremendous risk because so
little is known.  This is point in the project where uncertainty is the highest.
There are unclear goals, customer needs, technical solutions, and tools that
undermine our ability to plan and budget.

At this early stage important decisions can have profound consequences on the
success of the overall project.  A single mistake can sink the project. We must
work to eliminate as much risk as possible as quickly as possible.  We must
perform experiments that yield fundamental understanding that can then be
turned into a stable project plan. But planning without understanding is a 
road to disaster.

We must learn throughout the course of the project. Essential information is
missing at the inception of a new project.  We can guess and make assumptions
but we need to experiment to validate these assumptions. Erik Gries, in Lean
Startup, give a model for how a startup company can experiment to learn more about
the business it is creating.  This also applies to Fortune 500 companies that
need to learn about the new business opportunities being pursued. 

Leverage is also a fundamental part of the project planning.  Leaving leverage
as a afterthought will drastically reduce the amount of reuse that you will get.
Only by explicitly pursuing opportunities to leverage will you be able to 
maximize the development productivity that is possible.  All of this requires
a planning method that is very different than what you may be using today. 


**** Big bang planning

Traditional software projects begin with documenting the project requirements.
Based on these requirements a rigorous project plan is created for a single
large delivery that is either months or even years away.  Let's call this 
planning method the Big-Bang Planning.  It is built around one large payload
over an extended period of time.

The fatal flaw of big-bang planning is that it assumes that the world is a 
static place and that we have complete knowledge of the project from the start.
Both of the assumption are false. It is impossible to comprehend all of what
the project will entail in part due to an incomplete understanding, but also
because important things will happen throughout the course of the project.

With big-bang planning the changes and additional learning are largely ignored
and produce a great deal of wasted effort.  There is no good way to make 
adjustments during the project because changes are viewed as compromising 
existing commitments. But these commitments were made prematurely and based
on flawed understanding.

Companies that rely on big-bang planning typically create an adversarial 
relationship between the development staff and the business managers. The
business people ask for the impossible and the dev team fails to deliver. After
a few round of this dynamic their is a complete loss of credibility and trust.

Rigid thinking during project planning will always create this dynamic. Key 
decisions about customers, technology, product features, and implementation
details need to remain fluid for as long as possible.  In programming terms
we would call this *late binding*. It let's us lock down certain details while
letting us keep the available options open.  The more you can do this the more
successful you will be.


**** Flexibility create responsiveness

We need to resolve some details in order to move forward. Focus on short-term 
clarity that enables design decisions.  Some assumption will not yet be validated
and these will block vital decisions. Create simple experiments that will let
you answer these questions, and so let you make the key design decisions.

Some things you learn will surprise you. Many of these surprises will require
rethinking your assumed development plan. Be willing to make adjustments to 
realign the long-term direction.  Don't fail to believe what you just learned
because it is not what you assumed from the beginning.

Monitor all of the new learning that is taking place and changes that are
occurring around you.  Frequently these will demand a response.  Seek to 
incorporate the new learning into your existing plans.  By adjusting your plans
in small ways you can avoid big adjustments later and keep from losing work.


**** New learning

There are several areas where you can expect to have a large amount of learning.
