Advice to Live By

Josiah,

You are at a turning point in many aspects of your life. I want to offer you what I consider the most valuable nuggets of wisdom that will help you with your current decisions.  This advice is the culmination of decades of pondering and rumination.


Survive then Thrive

	Your well-being is essential to your purpose
	Health is about the weakest link: physical, financial, emotional, relational
	Get core heath before you consider aspirations
	If you are not healthy you drag everyone around you down
	If you stumble everyone stumbles with you

Be Pragmatic

	Not every dream is realistic
	Unfounded optimism is called denial and will lead to a broken heart
	Forget the giant step unless you can build a bridge
	If you reach for the stars, you may get stuck in space without air
	Pursue opportunities that are similar to what you are already doing
	Attack from a stable base, and retreat when the attack fails

Focus on Control

	Some things you control, other things you cannot
	Forget everything that is outside of your control
	Accepting whatever you cannot influence is a sign of maturity
	It is essential for happiness
	You are responsible for everything that you can control
	Own your role in every decision you make (whether good or bad)
	A wise man builds a path to the destination rather than wishing he were there

Assess Risk

	Evaluate each bad thing that might happen
	Estimate the probability of each bad thing (be brutally honest)
	Calculate the overall probability of success
	Prune any plan that does not produce a 70% likelihood of success
	Go for the most ambitious goal with a guaranteed success rate

Avoid Magic

	A miracle occurs when God chooses to violate physics to save us
	Magic occurs when we choose a situation where a miracle is needed
	Faith is when we trust God in a desparate situation
	Presumption is when we expect God to do magic for us
	Miracles are awesome, but rare, and no plan should ever require one
	Magical thinking happens when we don't know what else to do

Build Margin

	Once basic needs are met everything else is margin
	Never sacrifice your core needs for an aspiration
	Create a defensive perimeter at your core needs (of well-being)
	Invest your margin in building a better future
	Strive to maintain a margin of 20% (in time & money)

Me First

	The desire to help others can only be fulfilled when I'm OK
	I must be healthy in order to be of benefit to anyone
	If I'm messed up I will only inflict damage on others
	There is a time to be concerned for others and a time for me
	Personal growth enables everything

Trust but Verify

	Some people are takers some are givers; know which is which
	Surround yourself with givers, and limit the takers to a max of three
	Invest in life-giving relationships
	Build trust with others (both ways)
	Have five people that you would gladly die for

Forgive Quickly

	Hurts happen
	It is easy to wallow in regret and self-pity, but ends in dispair
	Forgiveness is not really optional
	Lay it down and move on, then you will grow and heal
	Learn from mistakes, replace regret with resolve


These priniciples will serve you in every situation.  I have seen many people flounder because they have violated a few of them.  No one could possibly succeed without following this code.  Many good people fall into ruin by not understanding these principles or by not applying them.
