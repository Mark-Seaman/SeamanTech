* Ruthless With Waste *                 -*-muse-*-

Be diligent about eliminating waste.  Analyze, search and destroy. This is not complex but it is
hard work, requiring discipline. It is totally worth the effort.  Make every small investment pay
for itself before you start another improvement. Switch your attitude from "tolerate" to "eliminate"
when it comes to waste. Do less for more results.

Establish your own productivity standards.  How long do you think this task should take?  Can you shave a
little time off it?  Can you automate it completely?  Keeping a log of every task you do may help
you find waste.

How do you invest the savings?  Resist the temptation to work less.  Instead put the time that you
save into new tools, automation, and learning.  These will compound into future saving.  Your career
will take off as your effectiveness increases.  You will be able to accomplish much more with the
same level of effort.

Choose to spend money in order to save time.  Calculate the value of one hour of your time. Be
willing to spend your own money to redeem your time.  You will find that you can pay for a new
computer system in a single day of your time.  This assumes that you can get a the cheap computer
that will do some important task for you.

Don't hesitate to buy tools that will save you time.  Go through the calcualation of how many hours
you need to save in order to justify a new tool. Include the cost of setup and learning in the
break-even calculation. Most of these decisions are fairly obvious when you take the time to think
it through.

Study habits of people you admire. Identify your productivity heroes. Learn their secrets. Also study
your specific problem areas and what solutions might work for you.  Finally, share your secrets with
others.  They may already have solved your problems.  If not, you may have solved theirs.  That is
even better.
