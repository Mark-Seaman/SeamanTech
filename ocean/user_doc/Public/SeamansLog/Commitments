* Make Effective Commitments *                 -*-muse-*-

Learn essential skills to improve the commitments that you make.  Our work succcess is directly tied
to the expectations of others.  Choosing and communicating our commitments  are skills that we must
master in order to be successful.

This starts by truly understanding the constraints we face.  We need to accept reality and build
upon it.  At the same time we should challenge current boundaries and explore alternatives. It may
help for you to write down the constraints that can't be changed.

Do not be swept along with the tide.  Instead make decisions about the things you are committed to.
Gather all of the relevant data and evaluate alternatives. When you have done this you can
confidently commit to action.  Now you can communicate your decision to others with clarity.
        
Setting the expectations is a core part of making commitments.  Demonstrate an understanding of the
business needs that are at stake. Show what you can do, and what you cannot. Highlight any risks
that you might see.

Once you have made a commitment, communicate progress regularly.  This will give people confidence
that the desired results will be achieved.  Reiterate the overall plan and show how the progress is
being made. Communicate current risks quickly.  Don't save them for a nasty surprise later. Discuss
any adjustments needed early.

People that excell at making effective commitments will be successful.  There will be less conflict
and more alignment with those who count on you.  This is a core competency that will be useful in
every area of your life.
