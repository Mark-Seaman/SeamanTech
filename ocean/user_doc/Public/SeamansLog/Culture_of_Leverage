Build a culture of Leverage

Culture and world view

My father is a cultural anthropologist. I grew up on stories of strange customs that other people had. A recurring theme was understanding why people do seamingly irrational things. The answers can be found by understanding the culture and the world view that drives it.

Later, when I entered the world of high-tech I found another strange culture was at play.  A strong world view applied to everything we did.  Those that violated the code were severly punished. A some were deeds would cause active banshment for life.

While readily adopting this world view, I remained puzzled over many  of the inconsistencies that were present.  The rules are seldom recorded but strictly enforced by everyone in the community.

Some communities actually do document their world view to help newcomers understand.  The HP Way and the Python Code of Conduct, both describe in principle that are valued and the practices that they demand.  This can be really helpful to avoid a cultural fauex-pas.

In order to build or change a culture you must truly understand what drives it. Lets explore the high-tech culture and see how we can affect a possitive change.  We will study the believes that drive behavior in order to influence the harmful dysfunction that we see. This is the only path possible to meaningful change.


Belief systems

Cultures are driven by a world view. A person's world view is unseen by them until someone opposes it. There is a reality that is readily embraced and never questioned.  One of the extremely difficult things about addolescence is that we must grapple with these world-view issues in order to embrace adulthood.

An entire world view is supported by specific paradigms, which each provide a fundamental understanding of the world.  A common mental model allows everyone in the community to be aligned, by sharing the same beliefs. We believe that all normal and decent people think the same way.

We choose to be a part of a community because we share a large number of paradigms with them.  We resonate with the ideas that are shared and are repelled by those we don't.

Let me illustrate this with two examples. The open source community believes that sharing is good. It is a self-evident truth that ideas should be readily exchanged with little thought to collecting money.  While the fortune 500 culture this in terms of theivery of intellectual property.  Every thought is owned and must be accounted for.

Which one is right?  They are opposing paradigms.  It will depend on which community you are drawn to. Once you make this choice it becomes very difficult to function under another paradigm.

Some cultures promote sharing of information. People are rewarded for helping others and furthering the cause of understanding. In other cultures, people are rewarded for knowing more than anyone else.  Most accademic and corporate evironment discourage any helping of others as a loss of personal advantage.

The corporate environment where I spend the bulk of my career was based on a forced ranking of employees doing the same job. Helping someone else might move you from a 62% rating to a 60%. Employees would actively sabatoge the success of others in subtle but constant ways.


Revolution

What happens when we find ourselves in an organization where we don't share the accepted paradigms? This really depends on the level of the disconnect. Any rejection of a paradigm will make you an outsider.

If you do not share the world view as a whole you are not even a member of the community.  You never will be and you need to find your community elsewhere.  But what if you share most of the beliefs but not all?  Is there enough connection to stay?

If you find yourself at odds with a single set of believes you only have several choices:

* Surrender - Realize that there are enough other things that are good that you are willing to put up with the constant foolishness.
* Adopt - You might take on the beliefs of the community in order to be at peace and in time begin to believe that way.
* Adapt - Sometimes the practices can be changed without challenging the underlying belief system. This is how I brought Agile software development into my working teams at HP.
* Challenge - Some beliefs need to be changed. Constantly pointing out the dysfunction requires a tremendous amount of courage. Be ready for the slap-down that is reserved for agitators.
* Revolt - As a last resort you might consider building a power network of like-minded people that will band together to overturn the current thinking.  This requires carefully thinking through both the technical and cultural challenges that you are facing.


Call to action

Recognizing the disconnect is the most important step. Is there enough for you to work with or are you better off moving?  Not every battle is worth fighting and you must limit your efforts to one or two key issues. 

But all of this should be a very conscious decision. Whether you leave or stay and fight you choose, rather than someone else. Many people just feel trapped, which is nothing more than the Surrender option. Don't choose that by default, when you have other options.

Once you have identified an issue that you need to address, you are ready to choose your response.  What role is you best path forward?  Consider answering the following questions:

* How much energy are you willing to invest in order to change the issue?
* Who are the people that share my beliefs and what are they willing to do as allies?
* How deep does the change have to go in order to get a good outcome?
* What types of resources can I apply to affect the change?
* What kind of trust do I have within the community?
* Am I better off to just ignore the issue or is it an absolute "deal breaker"?
* What possible paths could I take and what are the likely outcome?

These are extremely difficult questions to answer. But the conflict is already there and you are simply figuring out the best way to resolve it.  Choose a path that is consistent with your career goals.

Some people fight about everything, and others will never choose to rock the boat. Choose a role that matches your personal growth.  Who do you want to become? A person is largely determined by the struggles that they engage in.

Finally, enjoy the ride.  Consider the adventure.  You have the making of a great story line.  You have the battle for right and wrong, with allies and enemies, with some important objective at risk.  Celebrate you victories and mourn your losses. Be a hero!
