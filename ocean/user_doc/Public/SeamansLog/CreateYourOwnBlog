* Create Your Own Blog *                 -*-muse-*-

It has never been easier to create your own blog.  If you like to write then maybe now is the time
to create a blog.  Tools are available for free and easy to use.  

You should start with http://wordpress.com.  This site lets you create a blog and host it for free.
You can upgrade your site later when you want more control over how it looks and behaves. But don't
worry about that now.

You can also host your own version of Word Press on your own computer, but this is not a good
investment of your time.  My policy is to use external hosting for everything unless there is a
compelling business reason not to.  My geeky friends disagree, because they just like messing with
computers.

Create a blog around a topic that you feel passionate about.  Select an area where you feel like you
have a unique viewpoint that you want to share with others.  Consider your writing as an enjoyable
passtime, not a business venture.

Don't worry about who will read it now.  If your material is good enough you may find a following.
But if you are constantly thinking about how many readers you have then it will kill the fun of the
whole project.

View the act of creatively expressing yourself as an end in itself.  If you are having fun, or
growing as a person, the it is all worthwhile.

I recently heard a talk from the CTO at Google, claiming that the world is publishing enough material
for 16 feet of bookshelf space for every single person on the planet.  Clearly much of what is
written is read by no one.

Sharing your ideas with others is a great way to connect with old friends and make new ones.
Writing a blog is a great way to jump start this process.  You can have a new blog running in less
than an hour.
