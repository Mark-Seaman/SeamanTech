I've been studying technology trends for many years.  I am especially interested in the
impact of technology on our daily lives.

Here are two truths about modern life: Change is accelerating at break-neck speed. If we do
not manage it, our lives will become increasingly frustrating.

I have a love-hate relationship with technology.  It solves some problems while making new ones.  I
am regularly discussing these issues with my friends.  Many of them have encouraged me to write down
these thoughts and share them.

Seaman's Log is a free email list that will provide insights on thriving in the modern world.  It
will provide tips to make everyday life more interesting and less stressful.

I've been studying these issues for years and would like to share the results with you.  Let me know
if you are interested in receiving this info.

Your privacy is important. Let me if you wish to be included in this discussion, or if you would rather 
not receive further email.
