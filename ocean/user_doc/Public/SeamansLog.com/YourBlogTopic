* Selecting Your Blog Topic *                                                                -*-muse-*-

When you have selected your topic write a charter.  State what you want to write about.  This will
help you stay on your topic.  Identify the bulls-eye of what you think your primary message
is about.

Be willing to go beyond this primary topic, but somehow tie your discussion back into it.  Don't
force yourself to only write about main subject, since this might lead to repetition.

I recommend writing on a regular schedule.  Select either weekly or monthly.  Any less frequently,
and your blog will become an abandoned source of shame to you.  No one needs another "to-do" that
you "to-didn't".

Who is your reader?  This is an important question.  I write for a person just like me to share
ideas on best practices.  I can be assured that my dopple-ganger in the alternate universe is
interested in the same topics that I am.  I also hope that real people in this universe are
facinated by the same subjects.

I think it is better to start by selecting a subject that you feel passion about, than targeting a
specific audience.  Ultimately, your readers will end up people who are interested in what you have
to say.  The more passion you have, the more interesting your writing will be.

Approach writing as a journey.  Each time you write it will be a little better.  Don't expect to be
a master at the beginning.  Occasionally go back and rework past article with a new viewpoint.  This
will reveal how much your skill has grown in the elapsed time period.

Writing can be very satisfying.  Approach it with the right attitude, and feel the joy that comes as
a result.
