10 Commandments to Avoid Hostility with Friends and Coworkers

1. Never email more than 10 people 

    * people are less interested than you think

2. Always use an opt-in list for publishing content 

    * let people control what they receive

3. Never reply to a distribution list 

    * start a separate conversation

4. Do not send email longer than 500 words 

    * write a document, attach it, and explain what you want

5. Try to limit to yourself to five sentences 

    * write why, what, and what action you expect

6. Do not send email when you are drunk or angry 

    * sometimes it is hard to tell the difference

7. Do not forward links unless you know it is of interest 

    * post it on Facebook instead

8. Respond within 24 hours 

    * every query should get a response, but not instantly

9. Send fewer emails 

    * every send starts a conversation which requires your future time

10. Consistently remind people of the proper etiquette 

    * write your own rules and send a copy for each violation


Following these simple rules will improve all of our lives and give us the
energy that we need to respond to new demands.
