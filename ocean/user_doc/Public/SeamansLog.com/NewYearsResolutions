* How New Year's Resolutions Harm *                 -*-muse-*-

We all want to change, but New Year's Resolutions can backfire.

Consider these four reasons for why they can harm you...

 1. New habits are based on quick success

 2. Setting goals annually is not often enough

 3. We are tempted to dream instead of acting

 4. Failing at a big goal produces hopelessness

Motivation is the key to change.  And there is nothing more inspiring than an easy win.  It gives you
a desire for more.  

Why not use this process to rig changes in your favor.  Create a series of small steps that let you
experience the thrill of success over and over. 

Make small goals that you know you can acheive.  Constantly be aiming for smaller gains.  But attain
them faster.  Daily goals are much more effective at producing large changes than annual ones.

If something is worth doing, it is worth doing now!  Why wait for a whole year before committing to
new goals.  Because January is the month of new commitments, February is often the month of
disappointment and self-loathing.

Foget this annnual madness.  Resolve to not make any more New Year's resolutions.  Instead commit to
daily process of following your dreams.  Get in touch with what you really want from life.  Then
begin to make a little bit of that happen every day.

Dreaming is only valuable if it leads to action.  Broken dreams are just extra disappointments that
act as fuel for the bonfire of our lives. 

Goals that we cannot meet are demotivating.  Instead of creating big plans, choose the right
direction.  Then set off by systematically acting in a way to move you in that direction.  Plot a
direction, not the full course.  This is a shift from "planning" to "preparation".

At each step choose the smallest thing that you could be satified with. You will quickly find
yourself doing more and more.  Each step will lead you closer to the life that you really want.
