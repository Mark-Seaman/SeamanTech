* What I learned at HP *                 -*-muse-*-

I spent most of my adult life at Hewlett-Packard. This company is one of the greatest success
stories of the 20th century.  It dominated entire segments of the market and had a large role in
founding Silicon Valley.  Many other companies have their roots in HP.   The domination of the
printer business will be studied in biz schools for the next century.

What is the secret for making a great company?  At their core they are all built on sound principles
and best practices. Both Bill and Dave were giants when it came to innovations in business and
managing people.  The success of HP over decades is directly related to the principles and practices
they believed in.

**Building a great company can be repeated**

Great companies are based on a simple recipe.  It is easy to understand the principles that are at
their heart.  However, applying these ideas can be extremely difficult.  This is why so many
companies settle for lip-service rather than application.

People are the answer.  It is important to have people believe these ideas to the extent that their
actions change.  Belief without behavior benefits no one.  In fact, it is not really belief at all.
This problem is all too common in businesses today.

Great companies are constantly learning.  Business conditions are changing every day.  What worked
in the past may not work in the future. Learning is everything.  Stagnation can be deadly in business.

**No free pass to ongoing success**

Jim Collins wrote two very interesting books.  In "Good to Great", he defines how certain companies
achieve greatness.  In "How the Mighty Fall", he explores the path of how great companies fail.

Just because a company is great today, there is no assurance that it will be great in the future.
Success depends directly on practices that make you great.  Even the strongest company can decay if
it stops doing the things that matter most.

**Responding to current challenges**

In the last few years, everything has changed.  The road to the Great American Dream is blocked for
many.  I work with a lot of young adults, and am alarmed by how hard it is to succeed in our culture
now.  My kids and their peers have a much more difficult time than we did as young adults.

We need new examples for success.  These must be built on the same set of principles that made HP
great.  But the conditions are so radically different, that we need a new set of practices: ones that
work in the modern world.

What worked in past decades will no longer work.  Lifetime employment with a large company, full
benefits package, and a pension are gone forever.  We need new models of success that can be
emulated by the emerging generation.

These models must be built through constant experimentation.  I am dedicating the next ten years
toward learning how to create reproducible business models.  These models could be easily copied by
small groups of people to create new successful businesses.

**Call to action**

I am going to be using my company, Shrinking World Solutions, as both a laboratory and showcase for these
business ideas.  Our company will be sharing both our successes and failures as freely as possible
in order to benefit others.

I invite you to join us in the journey.  Tracking our progress will probably range from mildly
amusing to tremendously valuable to you.  We hope that you find our journey inspiring.

I welcome any advice or guidance that you might offer.  It is always valuable to learn from the
experience of others.
